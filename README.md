# Computer Graphics Project

This is the project for the Computer Graphics Course from the university of Politecnico di Milano.
The project is implemented using C/C++ and the Vulkan library, which must be installed by following the official [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment).

The project topic is:
Design a game in which a boat keeps going forward (third-person view) and obstacles (rocks) appear in its
path. The player must avoid the obstacles by using the keyboard to move the boat.
